# Electrocardiogram_Classification_DeepLearning_Project
We use the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database for training and evaluation, which contains ECG recordings collected from 47 patients at the BIH Arrhythmia Laboratory between 1975 and 1979. This database represents the gold standard in cardiac arrhythmia research and is widely used in both medical and machine learning studies.
